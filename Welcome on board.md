### Do Hard Things

Our privilege gifts us power, education, health, and an opportunity to solve the world's biggest problems. 
Education is possible, information is accessible, and we can use our capabilities to influence change and drive economic growth. 
The upcoming generation has the potential to be the greatest generation that Africa has ever seen, but we must keep going towards our goals despite others' disbelief. 
We never reach our destination alone, and with a mobile phone, any young person in Africa can learn new ideas and apply their brain power to solve problems. 
In Africa, one good leader can make a significant difference, and we should work hard to cultivate the next generation of African leaders.
